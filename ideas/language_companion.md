## 2. Language‑Learning Companion with Voice Interaction

### Core concept

Help users (especially less tech‑savvy individuals or older adults) navigate web pages and learn languages through voice interactions. The extension listens for voice commands, answers questions aloud, translates passages in real time, and highlights the relevant sections on the page.

### Implementation outline

1. **Speech recognition and synthesis**

   * Use the browser’s **Web Speech API** for capturing voice input and producing voice output. The specification describes how developers can generate text‑to‑speech output and accept speech recognition as input, and notes that the API is designed to enable both brief and continuous speech input.
   * When the user taps a microphone icon (or uses a hotkey), the extension starts listening. Commands like “read this page”, “translate this paragraph”, or “what does this word mean?” trigger different actions.

2. **AI comprehension and response**

   * Once the speech has been converted to text, use **Language Detector** to determine the language being spoken. If the user is speaking in Arabic or another language, automatically translate the question into English (or the page language) using the **Translator API**.
   * For questions like “Summarise this page”, call the **Summarizer API** to produce a short summary in the speaker’s language. For “Explain this section”, use the **Rewriter API** to simplify or expand the chosen text, adjusting tone for a learner.
   * Use the **Writer API** to generate example sentences or vocabulary cards from selected words.
   * The AI responds in text; the extension then uses speech synthesis (again via the Web Speech API) to read the answer aloud to the user. The response can also be displayed in a text bubble.

3. **Visual guidance and page interaction**

   * The extension highlights the section of the page being referenced or translated so that the user knows where to focus. If the user asks “Where is the definition of X?”, the extension scrolls to and highlights the relevant paragraph.
   * A floating toolbar provides controls for starting/stopping voice mode, selecting languages, and adjusting speech speed or volume.

4. **Accessibility considerations**

   * Use large, high‑contrast UI elements to cater to older users or those with low vision.
   * Keep voice prompts simple; provide feedback when the system is listening (e.g., microphone glow).
   * All processing happens client‑side, so sensitive content isn’t sent to remote servers.

5. **Feasibility notes**

   * The Web Speech API works in Chrome and is explicitly designed for voice input and text‑to‑speech, making it suitable for a Chrome extension.
   * The built‑in AI APIs handle text summarisation, rewriting and translation locally, so latency remains low, and privacy is preserved.
   * A solo developer can implement a minimal version with a few commands and expand over time to support more languages and more sophisticated interactions.

### Alignment with hackathon

This project addresses a real need (language barriers and accessibility) and uses multiple AI APIs, including the Summarizer, Rewriter, Translator and Writer. It showcases voice interaction, which is innovative and user‑friendly. The local processing ensures compliance with hardware requirements and data privacy guidelines, satisfying the **Functionality**, **Purpose**, and **Technological Execution** criteria.
