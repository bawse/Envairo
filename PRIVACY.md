## Third-Party Services

None. Envairo uses only Chrome's Built-in AI APIs (Gemini Nano) which runs entirely on-device.

## Data Processing

All sustainability analysis happens locally using:
- Chrome's Prompt API (Gemini Nano) - runs on your device
- Local CSV database (200+ materials with environmental scores) - included in the extension
- No cloud services or external APIs are used

## Your Control

You can clear all stored data anytime by clicking "Clear History" in the extension popup.
